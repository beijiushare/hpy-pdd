## Introduction

This is a Vue.js-based New Year greeting project. Let me explain the following to you:

- Sorry, my English is not good, this document uses machine translation. If you find any errors, please let me know.
- The project uses the `MIT open source license`, which means you can use, modify, and distribute the project code at will.
- Due to development capability limitation and usage scenario consideration, the project only supports viewing on the `mobile terminal`, and does not consider adaptation on the `PC terminal`.
- This is my first `Vue.js` project, first time using `TypeScript` , even first time making web animation, project management chaos (maybe not at all), rough production, please forgive me.
- Although my initial goal was to replicate the style with pure `CSS+TS+ still images`, I soon found it rather difficult and complex. So I ended up using two gifs (`Treasure Box Open` and `Stars`), maybe I should learn `Animate with AE` or find a `Design Partner`[Cover Faceü§¶üòµ‚Äçüí´], I heard [`lottie`](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_04f0aa/afts/img/A$>ZPyTSLUvGEsAAABjARQnAQ) is pretty good.
- Adding a raffle platter might make the style somehow closer to the pdd point, which will be added in a later version.
- If you like, please point a `star‚≠ê` for this project to encourage, thank you!

- Code: After opening the red envelope, the effect of fireworks directly uses the content of a [blog](https://blog.csdn.net/wrz2018/article/details/135275742), and some changes have been made. For the time being, I don't know whether the code can be used, so I will delete this part of the code in subsequent versions and rewrite it myself.
